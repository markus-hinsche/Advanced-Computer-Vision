    "In this project, we will talk about **object segmentation**, which is a bit different from the task you've done so far. In the object detection task, we have to predict a bounding box that goes around an object at hand, but now we need to make predictions on the pixel level! In other words, object segmentation is a task where the model needs to make predictions for each pixel in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of object segmentation is pedestrian detection. In self-driving cars, we would like to make predictions of car's surroundings as precise as possible. Having a pixel-level annotation for each object in a frame is a fantastic way to navigate around.\n",
